# RF-Coverage-Insights

Traditional drive testing tools have been expensive and time consuming to perform RCA
(Root Cause Analysis). Hence, telecom industry needs cost-effective solutions like App
based drive testing to meet its mobile network testing objectives and fulfill usersâ€™
expectations. 

We introduced Android based smartphone app and Web platform to assist
testers monitor signaling traffic at control points and then centrally examine to get valuable
insights and refine overall network health. To perform such action, telecom operators need to
undergo drive test analysis as per the specific network requirements. 

The app can easily process thousands of data to conduct mass drive testing.

## Problem with drive test our project solve it
**1. Time**

  Drive test takes a long time to measure the parameters because they go to all places
  by themselves by car.
  
**2. Money**

  it also costs a lot of money because they need cars to go to all places, devices and
  drive testers salaries, etc.
  
 by using our solution they do not need to do all of that because the users will help them to get
 these parameters in their places.

## The solution Consist of the follwoing

**1. Android Application**

The application collects different data, such as: cell id, cell type, MCC, MNC, IMEI,
IMSI, device model, location, Country, Operator, and Signal strength from the phone,
display it, and send it to Backend to process these data.

**2. Web Platform**

This platform takes the data stored in the Database that takes from user by our Android application
and display it on a map and also display the results of some analyzes
on a bar chart, one of them displays the average network strength for different
operators and the other shows the average signal strength for different types of phones
with different operators.
